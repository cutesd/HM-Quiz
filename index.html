											You may literally feel like you’re on the brink of starvation. You may feel desperate about time, money, and energy. You
											may have trouble sleeping at night, tortured by worry that your basic needs won’t be met. This may be true even
											if you actually have enough! The patterning is deep, and may well stop you from receiving abundance at all. You
											may feel resentful towards people who have resource, and may have a distrust of money in general….
										</p>
										<p class="card-text" id="med">
											Sometimes you may feel very stressed about having enough money, energy, and time to go around. This feeling of scarcity may
											come and go, or it may exist only in certain areas of your life. But it plagues you. Because your score is in
											this range, you have an excellent chance of releasing this block completely, and welcoming big abundance into
											your life unrestricted. I help people with this score all the time to step into wealth with my Money Program.
											You can check that out here: link
										</p>
										<p class="card-text" id="hi">
											With this score, you’re already plugged into abundance. You feel like you’ve got all the resource you need, and can likely
											manifest at a whim. I want to acknowledge you for opening yourself to abundance!

										<h5 class="card-title">MisTrust</h5>
										<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Your Score: LOW</h6>
										<p class="card-text" id="low">
											With a score at this level, you probably feel very stuck in the area of trusting other people. You likely feel suspicious,
											even when you don’t have to. And this lack of trust might have you paralyzed, unable to move forward and get stuff
											done, unwilling to delegate or ask for help. It can be so hard to make decisions and you constantly question yourself.
										</p>
										<p class="card-text" id="med">
											You likely feel trust issues come up periodically, and sometimes strongly. You may try to do everything yourself, just so
											you don’t have to go through the trauma of trusting in people and being disappointed! I work with people with
											this level of trust issue a lot. Trust is one of the pillars in my P.A.T.H. to Ultimate Freedom program, you can
											check it out here.
										</p>
										<p class="card-text" id="hi">
											You are deeply trusting person, and you likely follow your inner knowing without question. You delegate well and probably
											have a whole support team who has your back. Congratulations on doing the work it takes to open to trusting and
											living a supported life!

											You are hiding! And we miss you! You might be skulking through the world, feeling unseen and unnoticed. But truly, you are
											hiding behind a veil that may have been placed on you from a young age. You are the only person who can choose
											to take that veil off of yourself. Are you ready to be seen?
										</p>

										<p class="card-text" id="med">
											At this score level, you are likely emerging from hiding. Perhaps you have already taken steps to be more noticed in the
											world. Maybe you are sharing your thoughts and work more than ever. If you are in a state of emerging, you are
											ready for a program I have called the Powerful Communicator Intensive.

											You are likely a bit of a nervous wreck in how much you need to control everything in your life! It’s exhausting, isn’t it?
											You feel like you have to do it all, and then you feel pissy and exhausted about doing everything for every one.
											What if you didn’t have to manage so much? Are you ready to release your iron grip on the people and circumstances
											around you, so you can experience pleasure, flow, and connection?
										</p>
										<p class="card-text" id="med">
											With this score level in Control, you are likely growing your leadership abilities. You are learning to trust, and to allow
											others to do what THEY are best at, while you focus on your highest abilities. I love helping people grow in leadership
											during this period.
										</p>
										<p class="card-text" id="hi">
											You’ve got a great ability to surrender, and allow others to do their work while you focus on your strengths. This is a key

											you go to speak on stage or in front of people. You may find yourself dumbing down your truth so others don’t
											attack you. You may feel misunderstood often because you can’t easily speak up for yourself. Are you ready to
											speak and be heard? My Powerful Communicator Intensive is a safe space to release this chain and reclaim your
											voice.
										</p>
										<p class="card-text" id="med">
											With a score in this level, you are likely opening to speak out more in the world. Perhaps you are releasing old stories

											speak their truth in the world in ways that garner them respect, success, and wealth. Check out the Powerful Communicator
											Intensive which might be a fit for you...

											You may feel you’re in a fog. You may feel that other people are conundrums you’ll never understand. You may be baffled at
											how and why people do what they do. It’s because you’re blind in certain areas. But those blinders can be removed.

											own Sight. And I can help. Check out this offering...
										</p>
										<p class="card-text" id="hi">
											You see clearly. You don’t hold a lot of judgement on others because you can see and understand where they are coming from

											way, congratulations for having this clear vision!
