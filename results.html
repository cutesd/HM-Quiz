                                                You literally feel like you’re on the brink of starvation:  desperate about time, money, energy, love, or anything else that feels scarce in your life. You may have trouble sleeping at night, tortured by worry that your basic needs won’t be met. This could be true even if you actually have enough! This patterning is deep and may well stop you from receiving any abundance.

This feeling of scarcity may come and go, or it may exist only in certain areas of your life, but it plagues you. Because your score is in this range, you have an excellent chance of releasing this block completely and welcoming big, unrestricted abundance into your life.

                                                With a score at this level, you have a very hard time trusting other people. You likely feel suspicious, even when you don’t have to. And this lack of trust might have you paralyzed: unable to move forward and get stuff done, unwilling to delegate or ask for help. It’s hard for you to make decisions and once you do, you constantly question yourself.
                                            </p>

                                                Trust issues come up for you periodically and sometimes very strongly. You try to do everything yourself just so you don’t have to go through the trauma of trusting in people and being disappointed! The problem is this often leaves you exhausted, resentful, and feeling abandoned.
                                            </p>

You delegate well and probably have a dedicated support team who has your back. Congratulations on doing the work it takes to open to trusting and living a supported life!

It’s as if you have blinders in certain areas of your life. They were likely instilled in you at a young age, but it’s never too late to remove them and SEE with the clarity that is your birthright. Just knowing this now has already started the process of change.

Perhaps you’ve always been this way - or perhaps you did a lot of work to get here. Either way, congratulations for having this clear vision!
