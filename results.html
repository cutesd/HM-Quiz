                                            This quiz was created to help you identify which CHAINS are preventing you
                                            from fulfilling your greatest potential with ease and joy. Your full report
                                            will reveal more about the specific challenges holding you back. Before you
                                            view your results, here is a brief overview of the eight chains.<br><br>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            When you have the chain of SCARCITY, you’re feeling starved for something.
                                            It could be time, energy, money, love...anything. In some area of your
                                            life, it feels like there’s never quite enough - you’re not living in
                                            abundance or power.<br><br>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            When you have the chain of MISTRUST, you’ve got trust issues. Not only do
                                            you have issues trusting others, but most importantly you don’t trust
                                            yourself. You have a hard time asking for or accepting help from others. As
                                            a result, you often feel unsupported and overwhelmed.<br><br>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            When you have the chain of INVISIBILITY, no matter how hard you try, you
                                            never feel seen. You may even feel like there’s a veil or hood over your
                                            head, hiding you in plain sight. Perhaps in the past when you’ve tried to
                                            express yourself, you weren’t accepted or you were criticized, so you went
                                            into hiding.<br><br>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            When you have the chain of CONTROL, you have issues letting go. A close
                                            cousin of the chain of mistrust, you may find that you take the lead often,
                                            and then feel resentful that you’re left doing everything! You feel more
                                            secure because you’re in control, but ironically this leaves you feeling
                                            isolated and unsupported.<br><br>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            When you have the chain of REPRESSION, you feel silenced, as if you are not
                                            able to or allowed to speak your truth. You have trouble speaking up and
                                            letting your voice be heard. Ironically if you are repressed, you may also
                                            feel invisible. If you don’t know who your true self is, how can he/she be
                                            expressed?<br><br>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            When you have the chain of AMBIGUITY, you feel unclear and unable to see
                                            what’s in your way. Your perspective has been clouded by fear. When you
                                            break this chain, you’re able to reclaim your clear vision, know what’s
                                            coming, and see different possibilities.<br><br>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            When you have the chain of DISCONNECTION, you are not connected to the
                                            source of your greatest power - your higher self. You’re not accessing your
                                            inner guidance: the still small voice within. As a result you often feel
                                            powerless or out of control.<br><br>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            When you have the chain of INSIGNIFICANCE, you don’t feel worthy of great
                                            things. This may come from your past or from what you were told when you
                                            were young. But it keeps you small, always trying to prove your worth and
                                            value, without really owning it.<br><br>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            While each of these chains is represented individually, the reality is they
                                            all connect to each other. They are self-protective mechanisms that have
                                            helped you survive. Each of these chains likely served you at some point,
                                            but they must be released so you can thrive. The good news is that when you
                                            free yourself of one chain, it immediately starts to loosen or break the
                                            others. Breaking these chains is vital if you are going to own your full
                                            power. </p>

                                                You literally feel like you’re on the brink of starvation: desperate
                                                about time, money, energy, love, or anything else that feels scarce in
                                                your life. You may have trouble sleeping at night, tortured by worry
                                                that your basic needs won’t be met. This could be true even if you
                                                actually have enough! This patterning is deep and may well stop you
                                                from receiving any abundance.

                                                to go around. This feeling of scarcity may come and go, or it may exist

                                                With a score at this level, you have a very hard time trusting other
                                                people. You likely feel suspicious, even when you don’t have to. And
                                                this lack of trust might have you paralyzed: unable to move forward and
                                                get stuff done, unwilling to delegate or ask for help. It’s hard for
                                                you to make decisions and once you do, you constantly question
                                                yourself.

                                                You try to do everything yourself just so you don’t have to go through
                                                the trauma of trusting in people and being disappointed! The problem is
                                                this often leaves you exhausted, resentful, and feeling abandoned.

                                                You feel like you’re in a fog. You are baffled at how and why people do
                                                what they do - like they are conundrums you’ll never understand. It’s
                                                as if you have blinders in certain areas of your life. They were likely
                                                instilled in you at a young age, but it’s never too late to remove them
                                                and SEE with the clarity that is your birthright. Just knowing this now
                                                has already started the process of change.

                                                you can see and understand where they are coming from. Perhaps you’ve
                                                always been this way - or perhaps you did a lot of work to get here.
